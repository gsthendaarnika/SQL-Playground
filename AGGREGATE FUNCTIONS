#DATA TABLE PRACTICE (Aggregate Functions)

select * from data;

-- Q1. Retrieve the total sales for each category
select sum(total) from data group by category;

-- Q2. Retrieve the minimum quantity for each location
select min(quantity) from data group by location;

-- Q3. Retrieve the average sales for each category
select avg(total) from data group by category;

-- Q4. Retrieve the total sales for each category where the quantity is greater than 1
select sum(total) from data where quantity > 1 group by category;

-- Q5. Retrieve the minimum quantity for each location where sales are above 300
select min(quantity) from data where total > 300 group by location;

-- Q6. Retrieve the total quantity for each location where sales are between 300 and 500
select sum(quantity) from data where total between 300 and 500 group by location;

-- Q7. Retrieve the total sales for each location where total sales exceed 1200
select sum(total), location from data group by location having sum(total) > 1200; 
#HAVING is used for conditions on aggregate functions

-- Q8. Retrieve the total sales for each location where the total sales exceed 200
select sum(total), location from data group by location having sum(total) > 200;
#HAVING checks conditions on grouped results (not individual rows)

-- Q9. Retrieve the total quantity for each category where unit price is less than 500
select sum(quantity) from data where unitprice < 500 group by category;

-- Q10. Retrieve the total unit price for each location
select sum(unitprice) from data group by location;

-- Q11. Retrieve the total sales for each location only for the Furniture category
select sum(total) from data where category = "Furniture" group by location;

-- Q12. Retrieve the total quantity for each category where unit price is above 150 and total quantity > 10
select sum(quantity) from data where unitprice > 150 group by category having sum(quantity) > 10;
#HAVING works after GROUP BY, unlike WHERE

-- Q13. Retrieve the total sales for each category, but only for the location 'Tokyo'
select sum(total) from data where location = "Tokyo" group by category;

-- Q14. Retrieve the total sales for each location where quantity > 1 and unit price > 100
select sum(total) from data where quantity > 1 and unitprice > 100 group by location;


#EMPLOYEE TABLE PRACTICE (Aggregate Functions)

select * from employee;

-- Q15. Retrieve the total salary paid for each role
select sum(salary) from employee group by role;
#SUM() is used to calculate total salary

-- Q16. Retrieve the maximum salary for each location where employee age is above 25
select max(salary) from employee where age > 25 group by location;

-- Q17. Retrieve both the total salary and the maximum salary across all records
select sum(salary), max(salary) from employee;
#Example of combining multiple aggregate functions in one query

-- Q18. Retrieve the maximum salary for employees with the role 'Data Analyst'
select max(salary) from employee where role = "Data Analyst" group by role;

-- Q19. Retrieve the maximum salary for each location where employee age > 30 and total salary exceeds 150000
select max(salary), sum(salary) from employee where age > 30 group by location having sum(salary) > 150000;
#Combining aggregate functions with HAVING for filtering groups

-- Q20. Retrieve the maximum salary for each location where the role starts with 'HR'
select max(salary) from employee where role like "HR%" group by location;
